I am a Data Scientist in the Manufacturing field, leveraging data science to drive innocation and efficiency in the manufacturing process. 

Over the past two years I have been practicing my data analytics and data science skills with python in order to use those tools in my everyday life. This portfolio is a collection of projects I have completed to hone those skills.
